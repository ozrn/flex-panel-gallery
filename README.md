# JS30 #5: flex-panel-gallery
This is the fifth project of JS30 challenges by Wes Bos and displays how to create and design a simple flexible<br> image gallery using CSS flexbox model and vanilla JavaScript.<br><br>
What this does is that when a click event happens, the clicked image extends to show all content.<br> 
Once transition has completed, the image hides all content by getting smaller.<br><br>
You can see demo [here](https://ozrn.github.io/flex-panel-gallery/)
